# 0.1.1

_29th Feb 2020_

After Toby tried to start working on the main code base it soon become evident that the CouchDB set up was problematic. So I have moved this to environmental variables and now you can set up and use local and remote CouchDBs. The CouchDB needs to be on and have a server admin account so you can enter these into the environment variables. This reduces the process for onboard developers a lot!

### Changed

- Now using CouchDB 3
- Now using Environmental Variables (.env) to store the URL and log in for CouchDB meaning you can now change this information to suit your setup.
- Changed DeBug.vue to reload to your current install local or otherwise.

# Guide

## Use the following headers for each log

Delete as you see fit and use # for version number
